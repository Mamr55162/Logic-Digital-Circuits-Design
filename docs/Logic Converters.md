# Logic Converters Classes
## Overview
These are 3 classes of Logic Converters that produce multiple options the user can choose from, starting from two inputs up to 4 inputs, I will also provide a Multisim guide on how to use Logic Converters.
**Logic Converters can:**
- Design truth table from given outputs.
- Derive SOP & POS expressions.
- Calculate number of gates needed to construct an expression, assuming two-input gates only.
- Construct a circuit only from NAND gates.

Here, I will provide code walkthroughs and Multisim guide for each function.
## Two-input Logic Converter
The logic converters implemented in our code does not mimic Multisim components' inner algorithms exactly, the functionality of both however, is the same.
### Code Walkthrough
* **Truth Table Generator**:
A two-input logic converter is implemented using a class of public methods, we will analyze each method in code order, see the following code snippet for the first function, which generates a truth table depending on the given outputs:
```cpp
static void TruthTable(bool out1,bool out2,bool out3,bool out4)
   {
      cout << "A  B | F\n";
      cout << "0  0 | " << out1 << "\n";
      cout << "0  1 | " << out2 << "\n";
      cout << "1  0 | " << out3 << "\n";
      cout << "1  1 | " << out4 << "\n";
   }
```
Here the code is quite simple and brute-forced, it doesn't need any tweaks or complications, given the outputs, which the user must provide, the truth table is generated.
### Example Usage
The following code snippet provides an example.
```cpp
twoLogicConverter::TruthTable(0,1,1,0);
```
Expected Output:
```text
A  B | F
0  0 | 0
0  1 | 1
1  0 | 1
1  1 | 0
```

***Truth Table generated***


* **SOP Expression**:
In this function we generate a string of SOP (sum-of-products) expression from the given outputs, see the following code snippet:
```cpp

   static string SOP_Expression(bool out1,bool out2,bool out3,bool out4)
   {
      string exp;
      if (out1)
         exp += "A'B'";
      if (out2)
      {
         if (out1) // if there is a previous term add '+' between them.
            exp += " + A'B";
         else
            exp += "A'B";
      }
      if (out3)
      {
         if (out1 || out2)
            exp += " + AB'";
         else
            exp += "AB'";
      }
      if (out4)
      {
         if (out1 || out2 || out3)
            exp += " + AB";
         else
            exp += "AB";
      }
      return exp.empty() ? "0" : exp;
   }
```
In this code, we evaluate the truth values of each output, if it is 1, we append its corresponding product term from the truth table, in the following if conditions we have to check if there exists a previous term to append a plus sign '+' between it and the new added term, the function returns the string in the return statement if there exists a product term, but if the truth table is filled with zero in all rows in the output, the SOP expression becomes **0**.
### Example Usage
The following code snippet provides an example:
```cpp
    cout << "\n" << twoLogicConverter::SOP_Expression(0,1,1,0);
```
Expected Output:
```text
A'B + AB'
```

<img width="1117" height="304" alt="2 SOP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49dd0a07-2804-4d05-b68c-18a083099577" />

***SOP Expression from truth table***

* **POS Expression**:
In this function, we generate POS expression string from the given outputs, see the following code snippet:
```cpp

   static string POS_Expression(bool out1,bool out2,bool out3,bool out4)
   {
      string exp;
      if (!out1)
         exp += "(A+B)";
      if (!out2)
         exp += "(A+B')";
      if (!out3)
         exp += "(A'+B)";
      if (!out4)
         exp += "(A'+B')";
      return exp.empty() ? "1" : exp;
   }
```
The if conditions check the validity of the outputs, if it is zero, the if condition checks the inverse of it so it can work, every time an output is zero we add its corresponding POS (product-of-sums) term from the truth table. the function returns a string and checks if the string is empty it means that the table is filled with ones in the output row, so the POS expression value would be just **1**, if not then return the expression.
### Example Usage
The following code snippet provides an example:
```cpp
    cout << "\n" << twoLogicConverter::POS_Expression(0,1,1,0);
```
Expected Output:
```text
(A+B)(A'+B')
```
<img width="1417" height="385" alt="2 POS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a721a452-0142-4fd6-a1a1-a0de787c1d76" />

***POS Expression from truth table***

* **SOP & POS Gate Construction, and the NAND construction method**:
In these three functions, we try to compute the number of gates needed to construct both an SOP or POS expression, see the following code snippet:
```cpp

   //Derive the POS Expression from truth table.
   static string POS_Expression(bool out1, bool out2, bool out3, bool out4)
   {
      string exp;
      if (!out1)
         exp += "(A+B)";
      if (!out2)
         exp += "(A+B')";
      if (!out3)
         exp += "(A'+B)";
      if (!out4)
         exp += "(A'+B')";
      return exp.empty() ? "1" : exp;
   }

   //Compute and show the number of gates needed to construct an SOP expression.
   static void SOP_GateConstruction(bool out1, bool out2, bool out3, bool out4)
   {
      int NOT_count = 0, AND_count = 0, OR_count = 0;
      if (out2)
      {
         AND_count++;
         NOT_count++;
      }
      if (out3)
      {
         AND_count++;
         NOT_count++;
      }
      if (out1)
      {
         AND_count++;
         NOT_count = 2;
      }
      if (out4)
         AND_count++;
      if (AND_count > 1)
         OR_count = AND_count - 1;
      cout << "Construction : " << NOT_count << " NOT Gates, " << AND_count << " AND Gates, " << OR_count <<
         " OR Gates\n";
   }

   //Compute and show the number of gates needed to construct an POS expression.
   static void POS_GateConstruction(bool out1, bool out2, bool out3, bool out4)
   {
      int NOT_count = 0, AND_count = 0, OR_count = 0;
      if (!out1)
         OR_count++;
      if (!out2)
      {
         OR_count++;
         NOT_count++;
      }
      if (!out3)
      {
         OR_count++;
         NOT_count++;
      }
      if (!out4)
      {
         OR_count++;
         NOT_count = 2;
      }
      if (OR_count > 1)
         AND_count = OR_count - 1;
      cout << "Construction : " << NOT_count << " NOT Gates, " << AND_count << " AND Gates, " << OR_count <<
         " OR Gates\n";
   }
   //Compute and show the number of NAND gates needed to construct an expression.
   static void NANDConstruction(bool out1,bool out2,bool out3,bool out4)
   {
      int terms = 0;

      if(out1) terms++;
      if(out2) terms++;
      if(out3) terms++;
      if(out4) terms++;

      // A' and B'
      int nand_NOT = 2;

      // Each minterm generated by NAND
      int nand_terms = terms;

      // Final NAND combination
      int nand_final = (terms > 1) ? 1 : 0;

      int total = nand_NOT + nand_terms + nand_final;

      cout << "NAND Construction : "
           << total << " NAND Gates\n";
   }

```
In the first function we initialize all three variables with zeros, then we start our if conditions and each term we meet we add one to the count of the AND gates, if we encounter the first term ( 0 0 ), we need two NOT gates to get A'B', and to count the OR gates we use a general formula that applies to all inputs which states: **$OR_{count} = AND_{count} - 1$**, and finally we output the counts of each gate, the POS function is exactly the same as the SOP but we need two NOT gates in the case of the last combination ( 1 1 ), and the mentioned general equation would be reversed: **$AND_{count} = OR_{count} - 1$**.
As for the NAND construction method it is commonly used in real logic converters, because NAND is well-known as the universal gate, in our function we have 4 variables:
- nand_NOT, which indicates the number of NOT gates used for inputs.
- nand_terms, which is the number of 2-input NAND gates required to perform the AND operation on the minterms. Each term represents a product of variables.
- nand_final, An additional NAND gate to combine all the minterm outputs into one final ORed result using ternary if to determine its value.
- total, The total number of NAND gates needed.
Then finally the output line.

### Example Usage
The following code snippet provides an example:
```cpp
twoLogicConverter::SOP_GateConstruction(0,1,1,0);
twoLogicConverter::POS_GateConstruction(0,1,1,0);
twoLogicConverter::NANDConstruction(0,1,1,0);
```
Expected Output:
```text
Construction : 2 NOT Gates, 2 AND Gates, 1 OR Gates
Construction : 2 NOT Gates, 1 AND Gates, 2 OR Gates
NAND Construction : 5 NAND Gates
```

## Three-input Logic Converter

In the three-input logic converter class, nearly every function we talked about in the two-input logic converter class is the same, here I will discuss the differences and tweaks done on the functions, without going into too much details if not needed, see the provided codes in **src/** directory.
* **SOP & POS Expressions**:
The difference here is the optimization made, instead of making a code full of if statements that may reach up to 9 outer statements, we saved all the possible 3-input SOP ( the same applies for the POS function ) terms in a string array, and the outputs in a bool array and we loop through the outputs array, if an output is true we add the corresponding term to the expression, and we check if the expression is not empty we should add a '+' sign between terms, see the following code snippet for the SOP function:
```cpp
static string SOP_Expression(bool o1, bool o2, bool o3, bool o4,
                          bool o5, bool o6, bool o7, bool o8)
   {
      string exp;
      const string terms[8] = {
         "A'B'C'", "A'B'C", "A'BC'", "A'BC",
         "AB'C'",  "AB'C",  "ABC'",  "ABC"
      };
      const bool output[8] = {o1,o2,o3,o4,o5,o6,o7,o8};
      for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
      {
         if (output[i])
         {
            if (!exp.empty()) exp += " + ";
            exp += terms[i];
         }
      }
      return exp.empty() ? "0" : exp;
   }
```
### Example Usage
The following code snippet provides an example:
```cpp
    cout << threeLogicConverter::SOP_Expression(0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0);
    cout << "\n" << threeLogicConverter::POS_Expression(0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0);
```
Expected Output:
```text
A'B'C + A'BC + AB'C' + AB'C
(A+B+C)(A+B'+C)(A'+B'+C)(A'+B'+C')
```
* **SOP & POS Gate Construction**:
The difference here is that we use another approach, here we loop through the array of outputs and each output we add one to the AND_count if SOP, OR_count if POS, and we declare three boolean variables to detect whether we need a NOT gate for A, B or C, if the expression is anywhere less than 4 so A needs a NOT gate, if it is in ( 0,1,4,5 ) then B needs a NOT gate, if it is in ( 0,2,4,6 ) then C needs a NOT gate, to understand this mechanism refer to a three-input truth table, this logic applies for SOP, the same applies with POS with differences in the NOT gates conditions, after that we count how many NOT_count we need and apply the same formula we used before to get the OR_count from AND_count if using SOP, or the AND_count from OR_count if using POS.

***The truth table for both expressions A'B'C + A'BC + AB'C' + AB'C and (A+B+C)(A+B'+C)(A'+B'+C)(A'+B'+C')***

## Four-input Logic Converter
We will use the same method we used for the three-input logic converter, we will explain only the tweaks and new things to the functions.
* **Truth Table Generator**:
The tweak in this function is that we use bitwise and shifting operations to generate a truth table rather than 16 lines of std::cout, for the rightmost column (LSB) we use the bitwise AND operator, which determines if the number is odd or even by doing an AND operation between the bits of this number and the bits of the number 1, which is 0001, we use that because the least significant bit in the table is the fastest switching one, it switches states every row, in the second least significant bit we shift the binary digits by one digit to the right, if you write the binary digits you would notice that every two digits have the exact same second least significant bit, by shifting it to the right it becomes the LSB, and by doing another bitwise AND operation you will end up having a column that switches state every two rows, moving to the last column ( the leftmost ) you will notice that every 8 digits have the exact same MSB, so by shifting 3 digits to the right that MSB becomes LSB and we do another bitwise AND operation, you get a column that switches states every 8 rows, and that's how we generate the 4-input truth table from the following code snippet:
```cpp
static void TruthTable(
      bool o1,  bool o2,  bool o3,  bool o4,
      bool o5,  bool o6,  bool o7,  bool o8,
      bool o9,  bool o10, bool o11, bool o12,
      bool o13, bool o14, bool o15, bool o16)
   {
      cout << "A  B  C  D | F\n";
      const bool outs[16]={o1,o2,o3,o4,o5,o6,o7,o8,
                            o9,o10,o11,o12,o13,o14,o15,o16};
      for(int i=0;i<16;++i)
         cout<<((i>>3)&1)<<"  "<<((i>>2)&1)<<"  "
             <<((i>>1)&1)<<"  "<<(i&1)<<"  | "<<outs[i]<<"\n";
   }
```
All other functions are the exact same as three-input logic converter but cascaded to contain four inputs so we will not be discussing them, see the provided codes in the **src/** directory for more details.

## Multisim Guide to Logic Converters:
In this last section of the document we will be introducing the logic converter in Multisim and how to utilize it, the logic converter in Multisim can be found in the rightmost list of measurment devices.

<img width="377" height="208" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11fa2734-e89a-41d2-b1d9-88c07cbe2efa" />

***The logic converter symbol in Multisim***
The following list contains all the details about logic converters in Multisim:
- A logic converter can hold up to 8 inputs and only one output.
- Input pins are labeled A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H starting from far right, the last pin ( leftmost pin ) is the output pin.
- Connect the input pins to each of your inputs to the gates, whether you are using 5.0V Vcc sources or Interactive digital constant source.
- Connect the output pin to the output of any gate you want to analyze.
- Double click on the logic converter symbol to open it up and select from the Conversions list.

<img width="575" height="382" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5bfc4e4-c559-4eca-a5b0-dac0dd0bc1b2" />


***Logic converter window, inputs are A & B, output is the OR gate in A'B + AB'***

In the Conversions list you can choose:

1. Derive the truth table from the gates.
2. Derive the output expression from truth table.
3. Derive a simplified output expression from truth table.
4. Generate truth table from an expression.
5. Generate the gates diagram from an expression.
6. Generate the gate diagram using NAND-only construction from an expression.

***Simple Logic converter connection to AND gate to illustrate connection details***

>[!NOTE]
> - Do not connect the logic converter inputs before the DIP switch ,if you are using 5.0V Vcc, connect them after the switch.
> - Do not connect the logic converter output after the LED, it will be stuck at LOW signal, connect it directly to the output of the gate.
> - Do not use the logic converter while the simulation is running, make sure the simulation is stopped.
