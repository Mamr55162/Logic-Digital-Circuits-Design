# Full Adder
## Overview
  Full Adder circuit, unlike half adder, accepts three binary digits and produces two binary digits, sum and carry, Unlike a Half Adder, a Full Adder accepts a carry input, allowing multiple Full Adders to be cascaded for multi-bit binary addition.
## Truth Table & Boolean Expressions

| A | B | C | Sum | Cin |
| - | - | - | --- | ----- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  |   1   |

Sum = A $\oplus$ B $\oplus$ Cin

Cout = AB + (A $\oplus$ B)Cin

## Code Walkthrough
  The code in full adder is nearly the same as half adder except for the Carry input, here is the code snippet
```cpp
bool sum = Gates::XOR(Gates::XOR(A,B),C);
bool carry = Gates::OR(Gates::AND(A,B),Gates::AND(Gates::XOR(A,B),C));
return {sum, carry};
```
The function returns a vector of boolean values, first the sum which is computed by XORing the three inputs, and then the carry which is computed using the equation mentioned in ***Truth Table & Boolean Expressions*** section. All the gates used in **Gates** class are internally designed using only NAND gate.

## Example Usage
  The following code snippet provides an example
```cpp
vector<bool> result = combinational_circuits::Full_Adder(1,1,1);
cout << result[0] << " " << result[1];
```
Expected Output:
```text
1 1
```

## Multisim Design
The simulation uses:

- Three 5V Vcc sources
- Three DIP switches for inputs
- Two XOR gates
- Two AND gates
- One OR gate
- LEDs for Sum and Carry outputs

***Multisim design of Full Adder***


The Logic Converter can be connected to:

- Inputs A, B, and Cin
- Either the Sum or Carry output

*Logic converter with output connected to sum wire.*


>[!Note]
> - Do not connect the Logic Converter pins directly to the Vcc before the DIP switch, connect them with a junction after the DIP switch.
> - The DIP switches can be controlled by pressing the buttons labeled as "Key = " under the switch symbol.
