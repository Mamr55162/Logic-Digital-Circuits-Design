# Half Adder
## Overview
Half Adders circuits are an example of combinational logic circuits, it accepts two binary digits and outputs two binary digits the sum & carry, it is implemented using XOR gate for adding the two bits, & AND gate for computing the carry.
## Truth Table & Boolean Expressions
| A | B | Sum | Carry |
| - | - | --- | ----- |
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |

Sum = A $\oplus$ B

Carry = AB

## Code Walkthrough
The implementation of Half Adder in the code is a function with a return value of a vector of boolean values, it accepts two boolean inputs A & B, which are the two binary digits we will be adding, inside the function we declare the sum and carry variables each as a boolean data type, then we assign them values by accessing the class **Gates** and calling the gates methods, after the computation is done the functions returns both sum and carry as a vector of boolean values.
```C++
bool sum = Gates::XOR(A,B);
bool carry = Gates::AND(A, B);
return {sum, carry};
```

## Example Usage
Here is the code snippet
```C++
vector<bool> result = combinational_circuits::Half_Adder(1,1);
cout << result[0] << " " << result[1];
```
Expected Output:
```Terminal
0 1
```
## Multisim Design
The simulation uses:

- Two Vcc 5.0V sources
- Two DIP switches for inputs
- Two LEDs grounded for Sum and Carry
- XOR gate
- AND gate

The Logic Converter can be connected to:

- Inputs A and B
- Either the Sum or Carry output

*Logic converter with output connected to sum wire.*

  
> [!NOTE]
> Do not connect the Logic Converter pins directly to the Vcc before the switch, connect them with a junction after the switch.
